# Sound Integration for Kindergarten Learning Games

The kindergarten learning games now use online sound resources instead of local sound files. This approach provides several benefits:

1. No need to download and store sound files locally
2. Immediate access to a wide variety of sounds
3. Reduced project size
4. Easier maintenance

## Integrated Sound Resources

The following sounds are integrated directly from online sources:

1. Background music - Gentle, cheerful background music for the games
2. Button click - Simple click sound for button interactions
3. Card flip - Sound for flipping cards in matching games
4. Match success - Cheerful sound for successful matches
5. Match fail - Gentle "try again" sound for failed matches
6. Correct answer - Positive feedback sound for correct answers
7. Wrong answer - Gentle feedback sound for incorrect answers
8. Game select - Sound played when selecting a game
9. Game complete - Celebratory sound for completing a game
10. Bonus - Special sound for earning bonus points
11. Logout - Sound for logging out

## Sound Source

All sounds are sourced from Pixabay, which provides royalty-free sound effects and music that can be used without attribution in both personal and commercial projects.

## Sound Configuration

The sounds are configured in the `MoreOptions.tsx` file with the following characteristics:

- **Volume Control**: Background music is set to a lower volume (0.2) than sound effects (0.5)
- **Mute Toggle**: Users can mute/unmute all sounds with a single button
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if sounds fail to load

## Customizing Sounds

To customize the sounds:

1. Find new royalty-free sounds from sources like:
   - [Pixabay Sounds](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/)
   - [Freesound](https://freesound.org/)
   - [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)

2. Update the URLs in the `soundUrls` object in `MoreOptions.tsx`

## Important Notes

- Ensure all sound files are royalty-free and licensed for your use
- Test sound volume levels to ensure they're appropriate for children
- The games will function without internet connection, but the audio experience will be missing
